# A note on ports for same pod containers:

# Note: check apps router precedence from more to less specific, same thing with ingress paths
# If more than one pod/container has a "/" default path, all of them will be targeted and response will belong to the last? (check this)
# Depending on the required solution, using different services for each application will be easier to avoid conflicts
# ideally a app-name prefix could be added to all routers in source code ?
