                port:
                  number: 3000 # points to the port assigned to the read-write-app ClusterIp service (this is inside the cluster)

# A note on ports for same pod containers
# This can be done as long as the same service points to different ports, each mapped to the respective targetPort (the one decided for the app PORT env var)
# However, there is 1 path that, targeted to "/", will map to the apps "/hash" route used.
# For "/pingpong" path, this maps correctly to "/pingpong" route in that app.

# Did not figured out yet if the "/" is a requisite for ingress when using same service containers, or if I need to modify something in the app altogether

# Note: Issue is most likely related to routers path precedence and using GET in all cases. Check apps router precedence from more to less specific, same thing with ingress paths
